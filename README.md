# Lemin

### Goal
###### The project : make a GPS for ants !
###### The goal is to make an algorithm that allows the ants to move between rooms and tunnels, at the end they have to be in the last room.
###### There has to be just one ant per tunnel and one ant per room, except the first one and the last one.

### Understand the outputs
The standard binary display the number of the ant that move and where she moves :
##### Example : 
P1-2 --> The first ant move to the room number two.
P1-3 --> The first ant move to the room number three.
...
